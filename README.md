# My resume

This mini-project is a way to do my resume in a simple way, using only HTML and CSS instead of Word (for better control in the layout), also supporting two languages (English and Spanish).

I'm always updating it, so feel free to check it out and give me some feedback.

The deployment is on my domain [here](https://resume.s4n1ty.tech/).
